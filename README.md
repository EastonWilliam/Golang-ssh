# Execute command, Create, Upload and Download file using Golang

It is a golang based application to execute, create, upload, and download a file to and from a remote server using ssh and sftp package

This can improved by flag cli but my aim is to make you understand SSH and SFTP logic with golang

## Prerequisites

- Go
- SSH server with username and password authentication or key based authentication

## Demo



## Usage

This program will do the following tasks

- Execute a command on remote server
- Create a file on remote server
- Upload a local file to remote sever
- Download a remote file to local

```bash


# go to the 07-ssh-agent dir
cd 07-ssh-sftp-agent

# build
go build

# run

./go-ssh-sftp


```
